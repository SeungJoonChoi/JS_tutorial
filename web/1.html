    <h2>HTML</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</a> is a type of markup language.[1] It is used to make webpages. Webpages can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML tells web browsers what webpages should look like. HTML also adds meta information to webpages. Meta information is information about about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Web browsers usually do not show meta information.</p>

    <p>HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. CSS is used to change the way HTML looks. JavaScript tells websites how to behave. It can also change HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>HTML is made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are many versions of HTML. As of September 2018, the current standard of HTML is called HTML 5 and is specifically at version 5.2.</p>
